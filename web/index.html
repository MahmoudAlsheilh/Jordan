                            The name of the city reflects this interaction.
                            The earliest Arab/Semitic inhabitants,
                            who lived in the area during the pre-classical period of the 1st millennium BCE,
                            named their village Garshu. 
                            The Romans later Hellenized the former Arabic name of Garshu into Gerasa.
                            Later, the name transformed into the Arabic Jerash.
